<h1 align="center">Hi there! 👋 I'm Abdulmunim (Munim)</h1>
<h3 align="center">AI/ML Engineer | Passionate about NLP, Generative AI, and Scalable Machine Learning Systems</h3>

---

🌟 **About Me**  
I am an AI/ML Engineer with a strong focus on building scalable, production-ready machine learning systems. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Reasoning Models**, especially for **low-resource languages**. With a keen interest in **MLOps**, I bridge the gap between research and real-world impact by delivering end-to-end machine learning pipelines.

💼 **What I'm Working On**  
- **Personal Projects**:  
  - Fine-tuning **transformer models** for low-resource NLP  
  - Exploring **LLMs** for advanced reasoning tasks  
  - **Edge AI deployment** using TFLite and ONNX  

- **Workspace Initiatives**:  
  - Architecting scalable AI pipelines with **MLOps** principles  
  - Automating model deployment with CI/CD tools like **Docker** and **Kubernetes**

📚 **What I'm Learning**  
- State-of-the-art methods for **low-resource NLP**  
- Optimizing **large language models** for production  
- Advanced **MLOps** workflows with tools like **Airflow**, **MLflow**, and **Kubeflow**

---

💬 **Let's Talk About**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Tokenization, transformers, embeddings, and more.  
- **LLMs & Generative AI**: Fine-tuning, inference optimization, and applications.  
- **MLOps**: CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, model versioning, and scalability.  
- **Backend AI Deployment**: API design, cloud-based scaling, and serverless AI.
